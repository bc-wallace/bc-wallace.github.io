Hello! I am an atmospheric scientist at Leidos. My work primarily focuses on the utilization of high-resolution numerical weather models to address important research questions. I have a strong interest in Python and leveraging distributed computing to efficiently process large gridded datasets. More recently, I have taken an interest in alternative file storage formats and statistical downscaling techniques using machine learning.
